/**
 * Internal consistency of the archive's own record.
 *
 *     node scripts/data-check.mjs
 *
 * ── What this can and cannot tell you ──────────────────────────────────────
 * It checks the record against ITSELF, in two passes.
 *
 * The registry (`cases.ts`): that `lit` and `summarySlug` agree, that a docket
 * year is not in the future, that a proceeding recorded as concluded names
 * what concluded it, that an act the record names has a document behind it,
 * that no id or slug is used twice, that a stage does not contradict the
 * status text it was derived from, and that an amount is plausibly
 * denominated.
 *
 * The write-ups (`summaries/*.ts`) against the registry and against the pages
 * that render them: that a related card leads to a case that exists, that a
 * citation's kind is one the decision page can name, that the seat the map
 * draws is the seat the summary names, that every chronology entry carries a
 * sort key and that the key falls inside the date printed above it, that a
 * verdict track is authored in one run and that a track keyed to a day has
 * that day in the chronology, that the row and the summary agree about the
 * document's length and about which came first, and that the library's search
 * captions a decision page's band with the name that band actually wears.
 *
 * It reads the source files as TEXT — the same crude method the registry pass
 * uses, and for the same reason: these are TypeScript modules with path
 * aliases and plain `node` cannot import them. So it knows what a file SAYS,
 * and a change to the shape of these files (an entry reindented, a field split
 * across lines) can make a rule stop seeing its subject rather than fail. When
 * a rule is added, break something on purpose and watch it fire.
 *
 * It CANNOT tell you whether any of it is true. Whether ICJ GL 182 really was
 * decided on 2 February 2024, whether the Naftogaz award really was 4.63bn,
 * whether the ICC warrant really names those articles of the Rome Statute —
 * none of that is in this file's reach. Those are checks against the courts'
 * own documents, one case at a time, and a green run here says nothing about
 * them. Nor does it reach a claim made in prose: «≈6% основної суми» in an
 * `amounts.note` is a sentence, and no rule here divides one number in a
 * sentence by another.
