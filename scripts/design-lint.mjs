 *     node scripts/design-lint.mjs          report and exit non-zero on any error
 *     node scripts/design-lint.mjs --quiet  errors only, no passing lines
 *
 * ── Why this exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The design system was never the problem. `globals.css` defines nine type
 * steps, a 4px spacing scale and twenty-nine colour tokens, DESIGN.md explains
 * each of them, and AGENTS.md tells anyone touching the site to read it first.
 * A measured audit still found 94 hard-coded font sizes producing 26 distinct
 * sizes on a nine-step scale, 151 off-grid spacing values, 13 colour literals,
 * and three sibling headings of the same rank at 31px, 27px and 26px — set as
 * inline React styles, where no stylesheet could reach them.
 *
 * A contract nothing checks is a document, not a system. This is the check.
 * It is deliberately mechanical: it does not have opinions about design, it
 * only asks whether a value is one the system names.
 *
 * ── What counts as a violation ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A font size, a spacing value or a colour written as a literal, in a place
 * where a token exists for it. Three things are explicitly NOT violations,
 * because DESIGN.md says so and because pretending otherwise would train
 * people to add ignore comments:
 *
 *   - Illustration. The lamp, the projector and the map are authored drawings
 *     with their own register; DESIGN.md lists them as "bespoke, deliberately
 *     off-scale". Selectors matching ILLUSTRATION below are skipped.
 *   - Print. `@media print` wants real black on real white.
 *   - Geometry that is not text or rhythm. A 13px ✕ glyph, a 1px hairline, a
 *     2px optical nudge. Sub-8px lengths are rhythm-neutral and skipped; a
 *     font size on a glyph-only element is opted out by name in GLYPH_ONLY.
 *   - Anything inside `clamp()`. DESIGN.md is explicit: "Fluid gutters stay in
 *     clamp(). A scale governs rhythm, not responsive ranges —
 *     `padding-block: clamp(32px, 4vw, 56px)` is correct as written." A first
 *     draft of this file ignored that and reported 164 spacing violations, of
 *     which the great majority were correctly-written fluid gutters. A linter
 *     that cries wolf teaches people to skip it, so clamp() ranges are cut out
 *     of the line before any length is read.
 *
 * ── Adding to the system rather than around it ─────────────────────────────
 * If a value genuinely has no token, the fix is a token in `globals.css`, not
 * an exception here. That is what happened to the decision page's dark scene:
 * five hex literals became `--brand-night-rule-soft`, `--brand-gold-dim` and
 * `--brand-breach`, and two folded into tokens that already existed.
 *
 * ── The escape hatch, and when it is honest ────────────────────────────────
 *     /* design-lint-ignore space: measured against the zoom control *\/
 *
 * on the line above a declaration. It needs both the rule name and a reason;
 * a bare `design-lint-ignore` does not parse and does not silence anything.
 *
 * It is for values that are not the thing this file measures. Two exist:
 *   - `.nsv-hero` padding-top on a phone, 158px — clearance for the lamp above
 *     the wordmark. Illustration geometry, which DESIGN.md keeps off-scale.
 *   - `.mp-mast` padding-right in landscape, 330px — the width of the zoom
 *     control the title must not run under. A position measured against
 *     another element, not a rhythm chosen from a scale.
 *
 * Both were snapped to `--space-24` by a mechanical pass and both broke: the
 * hero lost 62px of lamp clearance and the map title started sliding under its
 * own zoom stepper. That is the shape of a legitimate ignore — the value
 * answers to something in the layout rather than to the reader's eye. "It
 * looked better" is not that, and neither is "I did not want to re-measure".

/* ── rule 4: a var() that names nothing ─────────────────────────────────────
   The most expensive class of bug this file can catch, because it is silent.
   CSS drops the whole declaration when a var() resolves to nothing — not just
   the colour, the entire property — so one wrong character takes a background
   or a font size off the page with no warning anywhere.

   Two of these were found by hand on 26-27 August 2026, and neither was
   visible in the source:
     - `.reg-name-uk{color:var(--ink-2)}` — the token is `--ink2`, so the
       Ukrainian line under every case name inherited full ink and shouted at
       the citation it was meant to sit quietly under.
     - `.casepage .mast{background: … var(--brand-ember) …}` while the token
       was still being added — the masthead lost its dark ground entirely and
       cream text landed on paper, twenty contrast failures at once.

   Definitions are unioned across every stylesheet, not read per-file: a
   surface legitimately uses tokens its own file does not declare. */
