 *
 *     node scripts/europe-map.mjs
 *
 * Why pre-project instead of doing it in the browser, as the old
 * public/nasvitlo/map-dark.html did:
 *
 *   - That page pulled d3 and topojson-client from unpkg and the country
 *     geometry from jsdelivr — three third-party requests on every homepage
 *     view, three parties learning every reader's IP, and three ways for the
 *     map to simply not appear on a network that blocks a CDN.
 *   - Its projection was fitted to the live container size, so the geometry
 *     could not be computed ahead of time. A fixed viewBox plus SVG's own
 *     scaling gives the same responsive result with none of the JavaScript.
 *   - Text inside an <iframe> is invisible to search engines and could not be
 *     translated, so the English homepage embedded a Ukrainian map.
 *
 * The output is committed: the build stays offline and deterministic.
