/**
 * Did the build keep the declarations the design depends on?
 *
 * Source being right is not enough to know a declaration shipped. Two things
 * between this repository and a browser can remove one without failing: the
 * stylesheet pipeline — Tailwind 4 runs everything through Lightning CSS,
 * which drops declarations its target browsers do not support — and a dev
 * server serving a chunk it built earlier. The second is what actually
 * happened here, to the one declaration that keeps a paragraph from ending on
 * a single word, and an afternoon went into blaming the first. Reading the
 * emitted CSS is how the two are told apart, and it is the only place either
 * loss is visible at all.
 *
 * So this reads what was actually emitted. It is the first half of
 * `npm run verify`, beside ghost-check, and it runs after `next build`,
 * against `.next`.
 *
 *     npm run build && npm run verify
