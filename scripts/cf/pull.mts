/**
 * Snapshot the published content out of EmDash, for the build.
 *
 *   npm run cf:pull              from the deployed D1 database (--remote)
 *   npm run cf:pull -- --local   from the local dev database
 *   npm run cf:pull -- --drafts  published entries with their unpublished
 *                                edits applied, plus never-published ones —
 *                                for the staging build only (docs/STAGING.md)
 *
 * Reads every collection described in site/content/collections.ts — only
 * entries whose status is `published` (a saved draft lives in `revisions`
 * and never touches these columns) — turns each row back into the value the
 * file in src/content exports, and writes `.emdash/snapshot.json`. The build
 * then compiles those values in place of the files' own (site/content/
 * vite-plugin.mjs), so the site is exactly what editors last published.
 *
 * A database EmDash has not set up yet — no tables, or no published entry in
 * any collection — yields no snapshot, and the build falls back to the files.
 * That is the first deploy: the site goes up from the files, and the admin
 * imports the same files as its starting content (npm run cf:content seed).
