/**
 * Homoglyphs, and other things that are wrong in a way nobody can see.
 *
 * A Latin "C" and a Cyrillic "С" are the same shape. One of them was sitting
 * at the front of «Cпрямування» in four registry records — the charge note
 * shared by four ICC suspects — where it had presumably been pasted in from a
 * document in the other alphabet. Nothing looked wrong. Nothing was going to
 * look wrong. But a reader searching the page for «Спрямування» would not
 * find those four rows, a screen reader announces the word in the wrong
 * language, and the string does not equal itself across files.
 *
 * This is exactly the class of defect that survives every review, because
 * review is done by eye. So it is checked by machine instead.
 *
 * WHAT IS ALLOWED, and why the exceptions are narrow:
 *   - Files listed in EXEMPT hold text ingested verbatim from a source
 *     document, quirks deliberately preserved — see the docstrings in
 *     summaries/dtek-krymenergo.ts and echr-ukraine-netherlands.ts, which name
 *     the two artefacts and say the tabs will be re-ingested. Preserving a
 *     source's transcription error is a defensible archival choice; making it
 *     silently is not, which is why they are named here as well as there.
 *   - A word that is entirely Latin, or entirely Cyrillic, is nobody's
 *     business. Only a word that mixes the two scripts is reported, and only
 *     when the Latin letters it mixes in are ones with a Cyrillic twin.
 *   - Abbreviations that are genuinely Latin inside Ukrainian prose — "IP-адреса"
 *     — are real and are listed in ALLOWED_WORDS rather than suppressed by a
 *     rule that would also hide real defects.
