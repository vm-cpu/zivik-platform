/**
 * Brand faces, self-hosted by next/font so they are preloaded and shipped with

 * <link> to fonts.googleapis.com swapped visibly mid-render).
 *
 * Three, not five. Newsreader and Fraunces came with the starter and were
 * still being downloaded by every visitor although nothing read them: they
 * reached globals.css as --font-serif and --font-display, and no rule and no
 * class ever used either.

/**
 * Roman and italic are declared separately because the Google loader emits the
 * cross product of `weight` and `style`, and the cross product was buying
 * faces nothing renders. One call for `["400","700"] × ["normal","italic"]`
 * preloads twelve files; a walk of all 96 prerendered routes in headless
 * Chrome, asking `CSS.getPlatformFontsForNode` which face actually drew each
 * run, found italic Charis on exactly two selectors — `.parties` on the
 * sixteen decision mastheads and `.nsvq-case` in the home pull quote — both
 * at 400. Bold italic drew nothing anywhere: `document.fonts` reported all
 * five of its faces `unloaded` on every page, while three of them were
 * preloaded on all of them. That was 40,608 B of forced download.
 *
 * Two calls for one typeface are safe here because this version of the Google
 * loader names the CSS family after the font — plain `Charis SIL`, no hash —
 * so both calls contribute @font-face rules to the same family and
 * `font-style: italic` still finds the italic ones. That is a property of the
 * loader, not of CSS: style matching happens inside a family and never falls
 * through to the next one, so under a loader that hashed the family names the
 * italic rules would silently render a skewed roman instead. The four rules
 * that go italic name `--brand-font-display-italic` /
 * `--brand-font-body-italic` so the split does not rest on that.
 *
 * The failure mode is quiet either way — a synthetic oblique looks like an
 * italic until you measure it. Setting the same string at both styles gives
 * different advance widths (150.6 against 161.9px for Charis at 16px), so a
 * width that matches the roman is the tell.
