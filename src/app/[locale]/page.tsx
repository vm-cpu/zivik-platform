        This band and the strip under it were `var(--surface)` — #ffffff, which
        globals.css documents as "cards / rows — float above the page". Used as a
        full-bleed ground it made the home page's largest light surface a card, and
        gave the page three light grounds where the system has two: white here,
        --brand-paper-2 under the slogan, --brand-paper under the partners. /about,
        rebuilt on the same two grounds, has no white on it at all.

        The change is invisible — #ffffff against #fbfbfa is 1.01:1 — and that is
        the point: nothing on screen was relying on it, and the palette now says
        the same thing on both pages.

        design-lint could not have caught this. It reads only `fontSize` out of
        JSX, so a ground set in an inline style is outside everything it checks. */}

            band is the site's one dark surface below the lamp, and it used to
            sit between two grounds of pale paper, so the page went light,
            dark, light and ended on a partner row that had nothing after it
            but the footer. Now the light half of the page runs unbroken — the
            summary, the slogan, the partners — and the dark begins at the
            quotation and does not stop: the Court's words run straight into
            the footer's dark, with the gold rule between them, and the page
            closes in the same colour the lamp lit at the top. */}

            it off. The button under the lamp now goes to /registry, which is
            the page that can sort, filter and search the same thirty-three
            proceedings. A summary of the archive on the way to the archive was
            a stop the reader did not need. */}

            It was a heading, a paragraph and a «Підтримати бібліотеку» button
            in a band of their own. The owner's note is to take the text off
            and move the ask — into the footer's contacts, where it now sits
            beside the address, and to somewhere near the top of the page,
            which is still open: the lamp carries exactly one button now, and
            putting a second one back there would undo the change that put it
