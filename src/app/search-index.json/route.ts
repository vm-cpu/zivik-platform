/**
 * The content search index, as a file.
 *
 * It used to travel inside `/uk/registry` and `/en/registry`. Measured on the
 * built documents: 73,676 characters of postings in the flight payload, 24,137
 * gzipped bytes of a 53,379-byte page — 45% of the Ukrainian library and 48%
 * of the English one, downloaded by every reader who opened the library,
 * including the ones who never touched the search field. And downloaded twice
 * across the two locales, because the postings are language-agnostic (both
 * languages of every field went into them) but the page carrying them is not.
 *
 * As one asset it is fetched once, cached by the browser, shared by both
 * locales, and asked for only when a reader reaches for the search field. See
 * `RegistryTable` for when that is and what the field does before it lands.
 *
 * `force-static` is what makes this a file rather than a function: the route
 * is prerendered during `next build` alongside the 96 pages, so it is served
 * from the CDN and nothing here runs per request. The index is a build-time
 * constant — it is computed while this module is evaluated — so there is
 * nothing for a request to add.
 *
 * The folder name is the URL and `CONTENT_INDEX_PATH` is what the client asks
 * for; the assertion below is the only thing standing between the two, since
 * a directory name cannot be spelled by a constant.
 *
 * ONE THING TO KNOW ABOUT SERVING IT. `next start` does not compress route
 * handler responses — measured on this build, 70,672 B for this file against
 * 23,282 B of the same bytes gzipped, and `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml`
 * come back uncompressed from it too, while every page and everything under
 * `public/` is gzipped. A CDN in front of the deployment compresses it and the
 * question does not arise; a self-hosted `next start` with nothing in front of
 * it would hand a reader three times the bytes. If this ever moves off a CDN,
 * put the index in `public/` — which is how `europe-far.json`, the map's other
 * fetched asset, avoids the question entirely.

 * reached that module — the Ukrainian library, the English one and this — and
 * each build worker gets its own module instance, so one number printed three
 * times and read as three indexes. Here it prints once per build phase that
 * evaluates the route, which is two — collecting page data and prerendering —
 * the same two lines `next.config.ts` already prints for SITE_INDEXABLE.

 * reader downloads, not an estimate of it.
