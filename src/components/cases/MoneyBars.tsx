/**
 * The money in the award, drawn to one shared scale.
 *
 * Props arrive locale-resolved (see CaseTimeline for why).
 *
 * ── Two things the drawing has to admit ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **The floor distorts.** A bar narrower than a hairline is not a bar, so a
 * figure gets at least 1.2% of the rail whatever its true share. On the DTEK
 * page the smallest sum is 0.26% of the largest and is therefore drawn some
 * four times too wide. That is a defensible compromise for legibility and an
 * indefensible one to make silently, in a graphic about money: every figure
 * prints its share of the largest as text, so the number is the record and the
 * bar is only an aid to it.
 *
 * That printed share, and the rail, are the whole of the admission now. Every
 * bar is drawn inside a rail that is the largest figure on the page, so a
 * small sum reads as a small sum rather than as a stub of unknown meaning; the
 * one on the Oschadbank page is 14px of a 1152px rail with «0,26%» beside it.
 * A sentence used to say as well that the bar had been widened — nine words in
 * the brightest colour in the block, under a figure that was already legible.
 * The floor still distorts, and the distortion is still bounded by the printed
 * number: at 1.2% of the rail no bar can overstate a sum by more than that
 * share, and it is the percentage a reader is reading, not the pixels.
 *
 * **The segments are not controls.** Each part of a split bar used to be its
 * own button, duplicating the entry for that part in the key below — two focus
 * stops for one fact, and on Oschadbank the smallest part is 2.6% of the sum,
 * which draws as roughly seventeen pixels of clickable target. The segments are
 * the picture now; the key is where a reader points.

     a dollar bar is a comparison nobody made. It used to be drawn anyway, with
     a note calling the bar "indicative"; then it acquired a printed
     percentage, which is the same error with a decimal place on it. Now it
     simply is not drawn.

     Declared before `scale`, which reads them. Written the other way round
     this threw "Cannot access 'l' before initialization" at prerender — a
     const is not hoisted, and the build is where that surfaced. */

  /* A bar shows its split only if the *narrowest* part of it is wide enough to
     be read as a part.

     The gate used to be on the bar: at least 15% of the rail and it could
     divide. But what goes wrong is never the bar's width, it is the smallest
     segment's — and that depends on how lopsided the split is. Oschadbank's
     principal is 74% of its rail and passed easily, while the third of its
     three heads is 2.6% of the sum: measured on the built page at 375px, a
     242px bar cut into 128, 104 and 6 pixels. Six pixels is thinner than the
     DTEK bar this gate was written to catch.

     So the test is the narrowest part as a share of the rail, and the
     threshold is the share that part needs to clear about 8px of drawing. That
     depends on the window, which a page rendered once cannot know — the rail
     measures 327px at 375px of viewport and 900px at 1000px — so the decision
     is made in two halves. Anything under 1% never divides: 8px would need a
     900px rail and no window makes that bar legible. Between 1% and 2.5% the
     bar divides and is marked `data-thin`, and the stylesheet collapses it
     back to solid below 900px of viewport, where the same segment would be
     six pixels. Oschadbank's principal splits 47/49/2.6 and lives in that
     band: three parts on a desktop, one solid bar on a phone.

     Where the gate closes the key underneath still carries every part with its
     figure and its share, which is where a reader was going to read them
     anyway. */
