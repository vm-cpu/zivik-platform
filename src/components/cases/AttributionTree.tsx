/**
 * Whose conduct counts as the State's.
 *
 * Props arrive locale-resolved (see CaseTimeline for why).
 *
 * ── Two stems, not five branches ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * The five bodies here are not five parallel facts. Three were organs of the
 * State (ILC art. 4) and two acted on its instructions or under its control
 * (art. 8), and those are different routes with different proofs — which is
 * the whole reason attribution is worth a diagram at all. Drawn as five equal
 * siblings, the one thing a tree could show was the one thing it did not: the
 * distinction survived only as small type inside each card's eyebrow.
 *
 * The stems are labelled from the block's own paragraph, which already said
 * "article 4 for organs of the State, article 8 for conduct directed or
 * controlled by it" — the words are promoted, not invented.
 *
 * One branch is always open, unlike the warrant ladder next door. The
 * difference is what the closed state would say: an unselected ladder is a
 * list of names, which is still an answer, while this closed is a root, some
 * branches and a blank — the sentence under it is the point of the drawing.
