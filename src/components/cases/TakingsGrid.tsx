/* Locale-resolved props, like every other client component here.

   This one took `Metric[]` straight off the summary — raw {uk, en} pairs — and
   being a client component it serialised them into the payload, so every
   reader downloaded both languages of every figure, label and note. That is
   the rule ARCHITECTURE.md states and the reason CaseTimeline's docstring
   gives for resolving on the server; this component was made client-side for
   the reveal and the prop shape came along unchanged. */

/**
 * The size of the loss, in three registers.
 *
 * A countable metric becomes one mark per unit — 294 outlets read as a field,
 * not as a number. A share becomes a bar against the whole. Everything else
 * stays a figure with its caption.
 *
 * ── What the bar is for ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It used to fill the share in gold and leave the rest as an empty track. On
 * this page the share is the 9.5% of deported children who have come home,
 * and gold is the colour this system gives to something recovered — so the
 * band read as a small gain against nothing, when the finding is the nine in
 * ten still held. The remainder now carries the page's own red — the colour
 * every other breach on it wears — and its own label, so both sides of the
 * proportion are stated.
 *
 * The fill grows from nothing the first time the bar is scrolled into view.
 * That is the whole of the motion here, and it is not decoration: a share
 * this small is easier to feel as it is drawn than as a printed percentage.
 * A reader who has asked for reduced motion gets the bar at full width with
 * no animation at all.

       A reader who has asked for reduced motion, or a browser with no
       observer, should see the finished bar rather than an animation or an
       empty track — but setting that state straight from the body of an effect
       cascades a second render before paint, so it is scheduled at zero delay
       instead and lands on the next tick.

       The other way is the failsafe. The fill's width is driven by this state,
       so anything that stops the observer speaking — a throttled tab, a
       restore into the background, a pipeline that is not running — would
       leave a reader looking at an empty track and reading it as "none
       returned". That is a worse failure than no animation, and it is silent.
