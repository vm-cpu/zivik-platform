/**
 * The way back to the masthead.
 *
 * It was the tail of `PageNav`, which also drew the page's map twice — a
 * dark pill fixed in the left margin above 1700px and a sideways-scrolling
 * bar of chips below it. The map is `CaseToc` now, a column in the page, and
 * this is what was left: a control that belongs to the page rather than to
 * any navigation, in the corner, with the whole viewport's corner to itself.
 *
 * It only exists once there is something to return from; offered at the top
 * of the page it would be a button that does nothing. An arrow and nothing
 * else, so it is named for anyone who cannot see which way it points. It
 * sits below the map's fullscreen layer on purpose — a reader who has taken
 * the map full-screen is not looking for the top of the page underneath it.
