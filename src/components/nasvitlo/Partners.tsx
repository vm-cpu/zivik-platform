/**
 * The partner band: who funded this, and an open door for who might next.
 *
 * It was a row of marks and nothing else — the whole account, on the owner's
 * instruction that partners belong on the home page and nowhere else (a
 * `/{locale}/partners` page and a header tab held the same single mark twice
 * more and are gone). What a row of one mark could not say is the two things
 * a reader actually asks: who is this, and can we be on it.
 *
 * So the band is two halves now. On the left, the support this archive has:
 * the funding line, the mark, the institute's own name and a sentence saying
 * what it is. On the right, the support it does not have yet: what a
 * partnership could be, and one way to start one.
 *
 * The right half is not the old support band coming back. That one asked
 * readers for money and was taken off by the owner; this asks institutions
 * for work, and the four things it names are nouns rather than links,
 * because there is no page behind any of them.
