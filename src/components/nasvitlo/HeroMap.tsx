/**
 * The map, as the ground the lamp lights.
 *
 * Not a second copy of `EventsMap`. That component is the archive's map — pan,
 * zoom, three framings, court cards, a legend — and none of it belongs on a
 * first screen, where the reader has not asked a question yet. This is the
 * same geometry with everything that answers a question taken out: no
 * markers, no labels, no legend, nothing to press. Six countries and Ukraine,
 * and that is the whole drawing.
 *
 * Why it is here at all: the owner's note is that the map should be the
 * background of the first section and appear when the light comes on. That
 * turns the hero's metaphor into a sentence the page can actually say — the
 * lamp is lit, and what it shows is the countries where this war is being
 * judged. Pull the chain and they go dark with everything else.
 *
 * It joins the family of things the lamp lights (`.bcone`, `.bpool`, the lit
 * wordmark): same `--lit` fade on scroll, same disappearance at
 * `[data-on="no"]`, same z-index 1 under the text at 3. Nothing here is a new
 * behaviour; it is one more surface the existing switch already governs.
 *
 * Marked "use client" despite having no interactivity, and the reason is
 * weight rather than behaviour. As a server component its 68 outlines
 * travelled twice in every home page — once as the markup that draws them and
 * again inside the flight payload, because that payload carries a server
 * component's rendered output. Measured: 136 occurrences of `hmap-ctx` in a
 * document that draws 68, and 60.2 kB gzipped for a page that had been 26.6.
 *
 * A client component is serialized as a reference and its props, not its
 * output, so the paths are in the HTML once and the geometry rides in a JS
 * chunk the browser caches and shares with the map's own page. It still
 * server-renders, so the light has something to fall on in the first frame —
 * a background that pops in after hydration is worse than no background.

 * The drawing's frame, with room on every side of it.
 *
 * The generator's frame is 1200x460 — a strip cut to hold Europe and nothing
 * else. A background cannot use it as-is: the hero is 2.2:1 on a desktop and
 * near square on a narrow window, and fitting either one means the continent
 * is drawn at whatever size is left over. Covering a square section with the
 * bare strip left 40% of the map's width; padding it only vertically fixed
 * that and left the desktop case drawing Europe edge to edge, at a scale where
 * the countries read as slabs rather than as a map.
 *
 * So the frame is padded on both axes — half again as wide, twice as tall —
 * and Europe sits inside it at about two thirds of the width, with room around
 * it for the crop to eat. Derived from the committed viewBox rather than
 * written out, so a regenerated frame brings its padding with it.
