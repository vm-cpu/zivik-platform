/**
 * Only what the bar reads, and nothing else.
 *
 * `Header` is a client component, so whatever it takes is serialized into
 * every page: into the RSC payload under Next and into the island's `data-p`
 * under Astro. It was typed as `Pick<Dictionary, "nav" | "brand">` — and the
 * layouts handed it the whole `Dictionary`, which satisfies that type, so all
 * of it went across: 8.6 KB of attribute on each of the site's ninety-odd
 * pages to read ten strings worth about 250 bytes. A `Pick` narrows what the
 * component may read, not what the caller may send.
 *
 * So the narrowing happens here, by construction: an object literal listing
 * each string the bar uses. Both layouts — `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` and
 * `site/lib/Chrome.tsx` — call this, and a new string the bar needs has to be
 * added in this one place, where the type will ask for it.
 *
 * A plain module rather than a named export of Header.tsx: a server component
 * that calls a function out of a "use client" module gets a client reference,
 * not the function.
