        Two lines under the quote, where there were four.
        Dropped: a link labelled with the full title of the decision on the far
        side — "СТОРІНКА СПРАВИ: РІШЕННЯ ВІД 2 ЛЮТОГО 2024 Р. (ПОПЕРЕДНІ
        ЗАПЕРЕЧЕННЯ) →", 70 characters of bold uppercase under a quotation —
        and the General List number (ICJ GL 182), which took the mono line from
        three facts to four.

        The long label was there for a reason worth keeping in view: the case
        page writes up a *different* decision from the one quoted — the
        Judgment on Preliminary Objections of 2 February 2024, not the Order of
        16 March 2022 — so the label it replaced ("Читати рішення" / "Read the
        decision") promised the quoted decision and did not deliver it. Naming
        the case rather than a decision retires the problem at its root: both
        decisions belong to this one case, and the case name is the title of
        the page on the far side. Nothing is promised that is not delivered,
        and it costs one line instead of two.

        The General List number identifies the case to a registry. The case
        page carries it, and no question a reader has on a home page is
        answered by it.

        `dict.quote.read` ("Читати рішення" / "Read the decision") is the label
        on the third line, which the owner asked for: the order itself, on the
        Court's site. It is the one link on this band that does deliver the
        quoted decision.
