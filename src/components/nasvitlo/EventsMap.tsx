   * round Montreal, and the result did not deserve the name it was given.
   * Measured on the built page at 1440: the frame came out
   * `-1000.9 -555.4 2200.9 1267.0`, Montreal sat at x = -936.9 — 64 units, or
   * 2.9% of the frame's width, inside the western edge — and what a reader saw
   * beside Europe was Greenland and open water. North America was in the
   * drawing (the atlas reaches x = -2658) and out of the picture.
   *
   * Two things were wrong with taking the window as the floor. It carries 323
   * units of empty steppe east of the last marker — MH17 at x = 876.9, and
   * Ukraine's own coast ends at 900.4 — which is a sixth of the frame spent on
   * nothing. And it treats the margin round an off-window seat as the same
   * kind of thing as the margin round a marker in Kyiv oblast, when it is not:
   * a seat is off the window because it is on another continent, and a frame
   * that clears it by 64 units shows the city without the continent.
   *
   * So the span is the markers themselves — `SPAN_EDGE` round the ones inside
   * the window, `SPAN_FAR` on the side an off-window seat came in from. Still
   * derived rather than written down: a second off-window seat, in any
   * direction, widens this by itself.
   *
   * What it comes to today: x -1296.9 … 1026.9, y -140.4 … 565.2. Montreal
   * lands 360 units — 15.5% of the width — inside the western edge, with the
   * coast from Labrador to the Chesapeake, the Great Lakes and the ground out
   * to about 96°W behind it, and Ukraine's own coast keeps 126 units of air on
   * the other side instead of the 40 the marker margin alone would leave.
   *
   * The frame is 2323.8 units wide against the 2200.9 it was, so Europe is
   * drawn 5.3% smaller in this framing than it used to be. That is the trade,
   * and it is a small one because most of the room America needed came out of
   * the empty steppe rather than out of Europe. The other two framings are
   * untouched: «Європа» is still the projection's own window.
