              landed and then a 107.56px one — measured with the request held

               The wordmark beside it is the archive's; this one is the

               The ceiling moves and the floor barely does, because they are
               constrained by different things. On a wide screen nothing is

               the nav is a burger and the bar holds the mark, the wordmark,
               the burger and the UA / EN switch; the mark is nearly two to
               one, so every pixel of height costs two of width, and at 375px
               56px was already enough to wrap the switch onto a second line.
               48px is the floor, one step over what was there.

               Blur is not a size problem and was fixed separately: this is an
