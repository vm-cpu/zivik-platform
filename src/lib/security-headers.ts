/**
 * Content-Security-Policy.
 *
 * The note that used to sit here said a real policy "needs per-request
 * nonces, which turns every page dynamic". That was the right worry about the
 * wrong directive. Nonces buy one thing: dropping `'unsafe-inline'` from
 * `script-src`. Everything else a CSP does here — `frame-ancestors`,
 * `base-uri`, `form-action`, `object-src`, and pinning every fetch to this
 * origin — costs nothing and needs no nonce, and the site was shipping none
 * of it.
 *
 * So this is the static policy: strict everywhere it can be, `'unsafe-inline'`
 * only where Next's own output requires it, and every page still prerendered.
 *
 * Why the two loose directives are honest rather than lazy:
 *  - `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` — a prerendered Next page carries 13 inline
 *    `self.__next_f.push(...)` blocks whose contents are the RSC payload, so
 *    they differ per page and per build. Hashing them means regenerating the
 *    header on every build for every route; nonces mean per-request rendering.
 *    Neither is worth it *here*, because there is no injection sink to defend:
 *    no database, no user content, no query parameter that reaches markup, and
 *    the one `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is escaped JSON-LD (`jsonLdHtml` in
 *    lib/seo.ts). Revisit this the day the archive takes input from anyone.
 *  - `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` — 74 `style=""` attributes on the home page
 *    alone, from React inline styles. `style-src-attr` has no nonce mechanism.
 *
 * What it does buy, all of it real:
 *  - `default-src`/`connect-src`/`img-src`/`font-src 'self'` — this site loads
 *    nothing from anywhere else (fonts are self-hosted by next/font, the map
 *    is inline SVG, the old unpkg/jsdelivr fetches are gone). The policy now
 *    says so, so an injected `<img src=https://…>` beacon cannot exfiltrate.
 *  - `frame-ancestors 'self'` — the modern X-Frame-Options, kept alongside it
 *    for the browsers that only read the old one.
 *  - `base-uri 'self'` — an injected `<base>` cannot silently repoint every
 *    relative script and link on the page at another origin.
 *  - `form-action 'self'` — the site has no forms; if one ever appears by
 *    accident it cannot post off-origin.
 *  - `object-src 'none'`, `frame-src 'none'` — no plugins, no iframes.
