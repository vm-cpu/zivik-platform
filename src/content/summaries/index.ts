/**
 * Slug → decision summary: the one list of pages that exist. The page
 * template renders from it, the sitemap enumerates it — one place to add a
 * case, one place for both consumers to see it.
 *
 * SECURITY — the null prototype is load-bearing, not a style choice.
 *
 * `app/[locale]/cases/[slug]/page.tsx` does `SUMMARIES[slug]` with `slug`
 * straight off the URL, and this route has `dynamicParams` on, so a slug that
 * was never built still reaches the lookup. On an ordinary object literal that
 * lookup walks up to `Object.prototype`, so five URLs a visitor can simply
 * type — /cases/constructor, /cases/toString, /cases/valueOf,
 * /cases/hasOwnProperty, /cases/__proto__ — returned a *truthy* inherited
 * value instead of undefined. The page took that as a real summary, skipped
 * the `if (!summary)` branch that renders the pending page, and died on
 * `masthead.parties`: HTTP 500, verified against the built server.
 *
 * Not an injection — the body is Next's bare "Internal Server Error" and
 * nothing of the object is rendered — but it is an unauthenticated 500 on a
 * public route of a site meant to be cited, one server invocation per request,
 * reachable by anyone who can type a URL.
 *
 * `Object.create(null)` has no prototype, so those five keys are absent like
 * any other unknown slug and the pending/404 path handles them. It also fixes
 * `slug in SUMMARIES`, used in content/map-links.ts and content/legal.ts,
 * which had the same blind spot. Keep the null prototype if this map is ever
 * rebuilt.
