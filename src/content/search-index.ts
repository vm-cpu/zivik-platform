/**
 * A search index over what the write-ups *say*, built at build time.
 *
 * ── The problem ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The library page searched five groups of row metadata — name, note, court,
 * status, subject field, date — and nothing else. Eight of the thirty-nine
 * proceedings have a full write-up: a plain-language summary, a chronology, a
 * table of the court's findings, provisional measures, a glossary, a who's-who
 * and an FAQ. None of it was reachable. A reader looking for «депортація
 * дітей», "universal jurisdiction", «тимчасові заходи» or "reparations" got
 * "Нічого не знайдено" from an archive that says a great deal about each.
 *
 * ── Why an index rather than the text ───────────────────────────────────────
 * The eight documents are ~730 kB of source. Shipping them to the browser to
 * grep is not an option on a site whose home page is already 94 kB. So the
 * text is reduced here, during `next build` (this module is evaluated while
 * the library page is prerendered), to the smallest thing that can answer
 * "which case, and where in it": a term → unit posting list.
 *
 * ── The unit is a section, not a case ───────────────────────────────────────
 * A row in the table is a case, but a match may be in a chronology entry three
 * screens down. Each unit is (case, section), and the sections are the decision
 * page's own anchors — `#overview`, `#chronology`, `#machinery`, `#rulings`,
 * `#measures`, `#handbook`, `#questions`, `#fulltext` — so a hit can be
 * rendered as a link that lands on the part that matched.
 *
 * ── Morphology, honestly ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Ukrainian inflects at the end of the word and this project has no stemmer.
 * Rather than pretend to one, every term is TRUNCATED to its first
 * `PREFIX` characters after normalisation. «депортація», «депортації»,
 * «депортацію» and «депортацією» all collapse to «депорт», and a query for any
 * of them finds all of them. What this buys and what it costs:
 *
 *   • It works for suffixal inflection, which is nearly all Ukrainian
 *     inflection, and it shrinks the vocabulary by a third.
 *   • It does NOT handle a stem change. «бібліотека» → «бібліотеці» keeps its
 *     first six characters, but «рік» → «року» does not, and «нога» → «нозі»
 *     does not. Those queries miss.
 *   • It creates false positives between different words that share a prefix,
 *     which is the same failure the row search already has and admits: «Крим»
 *     prefix-matches «Кримінальне». At six characters «кримін…» and «крим»
 *     stop colliding for full-length queries, but a query SHORTER than the
 *     prefix length is still matched as a prefix over the key set, so «крим»
 *     still reaches «кримінальне». That is a deliberate trade: a reader typing
 *     four letters wants the words that start with them.
 *   • Prefixes are not words, so nothing here can be shown to a reader. The
 *     index answers "does this section match", never "what did it match".
 *
 * ── What is NOT indexed ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `blocks` / `blocksUk` — the verbatim body of each summary — are excluded, and
 * that is where most of the 730 kB is. See INDEX_VERBATIM below for the
 * measurement and the reasoning.
