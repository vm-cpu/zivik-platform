/**
 * The about prose, with its citations turned into links.
 *
 * The paragraphs in `content/about.ts` are plain strings and are rendered in
 * two places — the home page's About band and /about — so a link written into
 * one of them by hand would exist on one page and not the other. The link
 * table travels with the prose instead, and both call sites render through
 * here.
 *
 * The match is on the literal phrase, first occurrence, once per paragraph:
 * the same rule `mark-terms.tsx` follows and for the same reason. A phrase the
 * prose does not contain is caught at module load in `content/about.ts`, not
 * here — by the time a paragraph reaches this function the only honest thing
 * left to do with an unmatched phrase is leave the text alone.
