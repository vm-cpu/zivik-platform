   * Two of the six are not places. «Воєнні злочини» is filed under the key
   * `mariupol` and drawn on Mariupol, and its content is the ICC's situation
   * in Ukraine entire — six arrest warrants, of which only some are about that
   * city. «Енергоактиви» is Ukrenergo, Energoatom, DTEK and Ukrhydroenergo:
   * generation and grid across the country, drawn on one point in the middle
   * of it. A dot is a claim about where something happened, and on an archive
   * whose subject is who has the right to name things, a dot that means "the
   * whole country" is a claim the record does not support.
   *
   * The answer is not to move the dot or drop it — a reader needs somewhere to
   * aim — but to say what it stands for: the marker keeps its place and the
   * ground it speaks for lights up behind it. "country" is Ukraine's own
   * outline; anything else names a path in `areas` in europe-map.json.
   *
   * The extents are not ours to choose. Each is the one the proceedings
   * themselves fix, and for «Схід України» that took asking the record rather
   * than guessing at a front line: the ICJ's operative paragraph in
   * *Allegations of Genocide* reads "in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of
   * Ukraine"; the Dutch MH17 judgment places the launch site at Pervomaiskyi
   * in Donetsk oblast; the ECtHR inter-State application is about the April
   * 2014 seizures in Luhansk and Donetsk; and Finland v Petrovsky is the Aidar
   * ambush in Luhansk oblast. All four proceedings this marker accounts for
   * name the same two oblasts and no third — so that is the ground, and

     third of the map's vocabulary existed to describe one dot. Worse, it read

     reasonably conclude that one is all there is, when the library holds
     thirty-one proceedings without a write-up. The map carries only what has
     been worked through, and the band above it now says so.

     Nothing about the proceedings is disputed and none of it is lost — they
     are itlos-15 in `content/cases.ts`, whose citation recites both the ITLOS
     provisional-measures case (ITLOS Case No. 26) and the Annex VII merits
     arbitration (PCA Case No. 2019-28). The marker's own note recorded three
     vessels and 24 sailors, seized in 2018, heard at ITLOS (Hamburg) and the
     PCA (The Hague); the `kerch` point is still in europe-map.json.

     TO RESTORE IT: put the event back with a `cases` array once one of the two
     proceedings is written up. Restoring it *without* a write-up also means
     restoring the «Ще досліджуємо» key — `legendUnlit` in both dictionaries is

     `hasUnlit` test in EventsMap), so it will reappear on its own. */
