/**
 * The amount at stake in a proceeding, as a figure a reader can read.
 *
 * ── The sign ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `RegistryCase.amountUsd` is signed, and the sign encodes which way the money
 * ran: the Naftogaz gas sales arbitration is recorded as −2.02bn because the
 * award netted *to* Gazprom. That direction is a fact about the case, not
 * something a figure in a table cell or a tag can caption honestly in the
 * three words it has. So every surface here prints the magnitude and labels it
 * the sum in dispute — «Сума у спорі» / "Amount in dispute" — and leaves the
 * direction to the case page, which has room to say it.
 *
 * Nothing here may sum these values. Thirteen of the thirty-nine rows carry
 * one, they mix claims still pending with awards already made and at least one
 * that ran the other way, and adding their magnitudes together would produce a
 * headline figure that no document supports.
 *
 * ── Why a module ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This was two private copies of the same function, in `content/map-links.ts`
 * and `components/cases/CasePending.tsx`, with the same comment written twice
 * and two different precisions. The precisions are a real difference — a map
 * tag has room for "$5,0 млрд" and a definition list has room for the whole
 * number — so both survive, as two named exports rather than two files that
 * happen to agree about the sign.
