 * partners of it. They are named where they belong — in the footer, on the
 * about page and as the controller in the legal pages — and listing them
 * alongside a genuine external partner both padded the row and misdescribed
 * everyone in it.
 *
 * Add entries — with a `logo` under `/public/logos/partners/`, supplied by the
 * partner — as partnerships are confirmed.
