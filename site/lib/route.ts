/**
 * Route adapter: runs a Next App Router page module under Astro.
 *
 * A page in src/app is an async function of `{ params }` that returns a React
 * tree, plus an optional `generateMetadata`/`metadata` and
 * `generateStaticParams`. This calls all three exactly as Next would, layers
 * the page's metadata over the locale layout's (`homeMetadata`), and turns
 * `notFound()` into the locale 404 with its own metadata and a 404 status.
 * The Astro route files stay a few lines long, and every page keeps a single
 * implementation shared by both builds.
 *
 * Every public page is prerendered. Content reaches this build as a snapshot
 * taken at build time (see site/content/), so a page cannot change between
 * builds and there is nothing to gain from rendering it per request — and a
 * good deal to lose: the invariants src/content checks when its modules load
 * would otherwise first run on a reader's request, and a bad edit published
 * from the admin would take the site down instead of failing the build.
