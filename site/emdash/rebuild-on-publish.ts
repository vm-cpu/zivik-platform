/**
 * Publishing in the admin rebuilds the site.
 *
 * Pages are prerendered from a snapshot of published content taken at build
 * time (site/content/), so an edit reaches readers through a build — which is
 * also where src/content's invariants run and can refuse it. This plugin is
 * the trigger: whenever the set of published entries changes, it POSTs the
 * Workers Builds deploy hook in the `DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` secret.
 *
 * Bursts are fine. Cloudflare drops a hook call that arrives while an earlier
 * one is still queued, so publishing ten entries in a row costs one build.
 *
 * Without the secret (local dev, a preview) it logs and does nothing. A hook
 * that cannot be reached, or a malformed secret, is logged with its cause and
 * never thrown: a failed rebuild must not read as a failed publish.
