/**
 * Refuse a save the build would refuse.
 *
 * Eight sections of a decision summary and the map's lists are raw JSON
 * fields (see site/content/collections.ts), and until now the first thing to
 * read them was the build: a missing comma was saved, published, rebuilt —
 * and the build failed on it, left the site on the previous version, and
 * failed again on every later publish until someone found the entry. The
 * editor saw «Опубліковано» the whole time.
 *
 * So the same decoding the build runs (`fromRow`) runs here, on save, and a
 * value it cannot read is refused with the field's own admin label. Drafts
 * too: a draft is where the mistake is cheapest to see.
 *
 * What this cannot catch is a value that parses but has the wrong shape — an
 * object where a list belongs, a key misspelt. The top-level kind is checked
 * (list or object, as the field has always held); the rest still meets the
 * content invariants at build time, which name the entry and the rule.
