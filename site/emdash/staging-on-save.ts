/**
 * Every save rebuilds the staging site — the preview of drafts.
 *
 * The public site is prerendered from published content, so a draft has
 * nowhere to be seen before «Опублікувати». The staging Worker is the same
 * site built with drafts applied (`cf:pull -- --drafts`, docs/STAGING.md);
 * this plugin calls its deploy hook after each save, so an editor saves,
 * waits two minutes, and reads the page as it will look.
 *
 * Silent until the Worker has a STAGING_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL secret. Bursts are
 * fine: Cloudflare drops a hook call while an earlier one is still queued.
