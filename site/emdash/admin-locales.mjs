/**
 * Ship the EmDash admin in English and Ukrainian only.
 *
 * The admin carries a translation catalogue for 29 locales, about 56 KB
 * gzipped each, and every one of them is bundled into the Worker whether or
 * not anyone ever picks it: 1.65 MB of a 4 MB Worker, over the 3 MB limit of
 * the free Workers plan on its own. This trims the two tables that name the
 * catalogues — the loader map and the locale picker's list — so the others
 * are never imported and never bundled. A locale outside the list falls back
 * to English, which is what EmDash does for any locale it has no catalogue
 * for.
 *
 * The patch targets EmDash's built files, so an upgrade that reshapes them
 * must not turn it into a silent no-op: if either table is not found, the
 * build stops and says so.
