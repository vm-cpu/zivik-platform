 * What reaches the Worker: the EmDash admin and its API, `/`, and 404s. The
 * public pages are static assets and never get here.
 *
 * The cron also retries a publish whose rebuild was lost — see
 * `retryMissedPublish`.
 *
 * Four things are settled before EmDash sees the request (the fourth, the
 * health probe's version, is below with its reason):
 *
 *   - `/` → `/uk` or `/en` by Accept-Language. Through EmDash it cost a setup
 *     probe and seven more D1 queries (~660 ms) to answer every visitor who
 *     types the bare domain. It is the same rule site/pages/index.ts states.
 *   - `/_emdash/api/search*` without a session is a 404. EmDash makes search
 *     public for sites that render from D1 at request time; this one searches
 *     a static index, so the endpoint served nobody but could make anyone's
 *     request cost 8–11 s of Worker time and D1 reads. The admin, which does
 *     use it, always carries the session cookie.
 *   - HSTS on everything the Worker answers. `_headers` covers the static
 *     files only; on a custom domain nothing else would add it to the admin.

 * site never changes. This cron already runs every five minutes for EmDash's
 * own scheduled publishing, so it also compares the newest live revision in D1
 * with the moment this deployment's snapshot was taken. A publish newer than
 * the snapshot and 10–15 minutes old means no build picked it up; one cron
 * tick falls in that window, so the hook is called once — never in a loop, so
