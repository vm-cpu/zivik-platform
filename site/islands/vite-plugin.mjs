/**
 * "use client" boundaries, honoured under Astro.
 *
 * The components in src/ are written for React Server Components: a page is
 * server-rendered markup with a handful of client components inside it, and
 * only those ship JavaScript. Astro has no RSC, so this reproduces the one
 * part of it the site relies on — the boundary.
 *
 * In the server build, the default export of every module that opens with
 * "use client" is wrapped by `island()` (runtime.tsx). The wrapper
 * server-renders the component as usual inside an <nsv-island> element that
 * records which module it came from and the props it was given. In the
 * browser, client.tsx finds those elements and hydrates each one with the
 * same component and props — exactly the set of components Next would have
 * hydrated, and nothing else.
 *
 * Named exports pass straight through: in this codebase they are types,
 * helpers and constants, never components.
