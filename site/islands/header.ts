/**
 * The header's burger, without React — for pages whose only island is the
 * header.
 *
 * On /about, /team, the legal pages, every pending case and the 404, the bar
 * is the one client component on the page, and hydrating it was the only
 * reason those pages loaded the island runtime: react-dom and the rest, about
 * 197 KB of script, to flip one attribute on a <nav>. Everything else the bar
 * does is markup — links, the language switch, the active item — and the
 * server has already rendered all of it with the right pathname. So on those
 * pages Document.astro loads this instead of client.tsx, and the server
 * render of Header.tsx is left as it is: same elements, same ids, same
 * attributes.
 *
 * This has to do exactly what Header.tsx does, no more and no less, because
 * the two are the same control on different pages:
 *
 *   - the burger toggles the drawer: `aria-expanded` on the button,
 *     `data-open="yes" | "no"` on #nsv-mobnav (header.css keys off that);
 *   - while the drawer is open, Escape shuts it and puts focus back on the
 *     burger, rather than leaving it inside a panel that is now display:none;
 *   - following one of the drawer's items shuts it (the support link opens a
 *     new tab, so the page stays and the drawer must not).
 *
 * A page with any other island hydrates the header with React as before —
 * see Document.astro — so there is never a second handler on the button.
 * Under Next the header is always React: the framework's runtime loads on
 * every page regardless, and there is nothing to save.
 *
 * Keep this in step with Header.tsx until the Next app is retired.
